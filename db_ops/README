Information

The project supports Create, Read, Update and Delete features as required. It does not include test cases.
The newMapper function has been slightly modified.
The second element of the array 'fn' should include code that updates fields in the argument object.
Example: "arg['field1']='updatedValue'"
newMapper adds the part of code that returns the updated value.

Instead of using mapper.call(null,d), Array#map(mapper) is used to transform objects.
